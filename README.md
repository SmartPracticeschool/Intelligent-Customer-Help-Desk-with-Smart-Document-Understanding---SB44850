 # Intelligent-Customer-Help-Desk-with-Smart-Document-Understanding

 
 

 In this project a chatbot is created which offers a complete and easy way to answer different sets of questions asked by the customers. With the help of Watson discovery channel it can also answer some typical questions about the operation of a device because we have feeds the owners manual to the watson discovery channel. The benefits of this kind of chatbot is that it is superior than the typical chatbot which can answers simple questions like store location and hours. The chatbot is upgraded with the help of watson discovery collection which is build using smart document understanding.

         It's main objective is to solve customer's queries as early as possible to save the time of the customer. 
         
         We will use the IBM cloud function that allows watson assistant to post queries to watson discovery.

         The goal is to set up a remote connection between the customer and the company. 
         
        
        
   *By this chatbot anyone can have their problem solved by posting queries to chatbot via being at home or without calling an employee.*
